You are a <b>speleologist</b>, a specialist of caves and you love exploring them. 
This time you are in Otranto doing research on the land with four colleagues. 

While examining the morphological characteristics, suddenly, the sky turns black and the earth starts trembling. A crack is forming under your feet and quickly turns into a hole...

There is a purple smoke coming out of it.

You and your colleagues fall into the hole and pass out.

<tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Go on">
You hear water dripping somewhere and regain your consciousness inside a humid and pitch black place.

<i>« Guys are you here? Are you okay? »</i>

Speleologist 1:
<i>« Yeah... I think I'm okay even though my body is aching all over! »</i>

Speleologist 2:
<i>« Still alive here too! »</i>

Speleologist 3:
<i>« Yeah I'm okay but what was that? »</i>

Speleologist 4:
<i>« I would feel better after finding my flashlight! »</i>

You:
<i>« Wait I had mine in my hands before....Where did it go? Ah, found it! »</i>

<tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Switch on your flashlight">
You and your colleagues stand up and find yourselves in front of some walls with paintings on them and quickly figure out that you landed in an underground cave. 

On the walls, there are geometrical shapes alongside figures that seem to portray humans and animals.

As excited speleologists, you start diving deeper into the cave.

<tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Start Walking">
While walking you start speculating on the meanings of the drawings and what they are actually portraying. 

Speleologist 1:
<i>« Hey, I think I see some drawings of people here... It seems like they have a bow in their hands so maybe they are hunting? »</i>

Speleologist 2:
<i>« I think you are right!! Don’t these look like animals running from them?! »</i>

Speleologist 3:
<i>« Guys, I see some handprints on this wall! »</i>

Speleologist 4:
<i>« Wow there are so many. It feels like someone would suddenly show up out of nowhere! »</i>

You whisper to yourself:
<i>« A dancing person, huh?... Could it be a dancing <b>shaman</b> maybe? It is pretty common to find paintings depicting a shaman inside caves, since they were important figures for ancient communities because of their role as ritual leaders. That would also explain the... »</i>

Speleologist 4:

After you and your colleagues are done exploring the cave, a glow appears behind you; leaving you with no choice but to turn around and find its source. 

You see the pictogram you interpreted as a dancing shaman actually dancing on the wall. The air feels heavy again, the purple smoke comes back alongside some peculiar scents.

Speleologist 4:
<i>« Oh no! Someone really did appear! I was joking when I said that! »</i>

While getting closer to the fire pit, you notice the dancing pictogram is missing and the person is sitting right below where it was.

Speleologist 4 reacts:

You:
<i>« Don't tell me... That's actually.... The shaman?! »</i>

The shaman says:
