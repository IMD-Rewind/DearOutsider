                <b>1. THE CONTEXT</b><br><br>
                The <b>Deer Cave of Porto Badisco</b> (La Grotta dei Cervi di Porto Badisco), discovered in 1970 near Otranto, is one of the most extraordinary prehistoric sites in Europe. Here, more than 7,000 years ago, communities left the largest and most complex ensemble of <b>Neolithic wall paintings</b> known on the continent. For a long time, the cave was a true underground sanctuary, frequented by groups even from distant regions of the Mediterranean.
                <br><br>

                <b>1.1 The cult dedicated to the Great Mother</b><br><br>
                Archaeological research indicates that the cave was linked to an important prehistoric cult: that of the <b>Great Mother</b>, a female deity venerated in many Mediterranean cultures. Indeed, in the Near East, the Balkans, and the Greek area, numerous statuettes have been found representing her as <b>Lady of Life</b>, <b>Ruler of Death</b>, or <b>Goddess of Regeneration</b>, protector of the cycle of humans, plants, and animals. The very structure of the cave, with corridors dozens of meters deep, reminded the ancient visitors of the womb of the Goddess, a symbolic belly in which to perform ceremonies related to the fertility of the fields, rebirth, and the protection of the community.
                <br><br>
                Many traces of ritual practices remain: remains of hearths, vases placed inside natural cavities or holes dug specifically, animal offerings, carbonized grains, ornaments and tools in various materials, even from far away. All these elements indicate that the cave was a chosen place for important rites and shared ceremonies.
                <br><br>
                The ancient visitors did not limit themselves to entering the cave: they transformed it. Inside the tunnels they built dry-stone walls, carved steps, and created artificial embankments. These modifications demonstrate that the cave was not a simple natural shelter, but a ceremonial complex designed in a unitary manner and used for centuries. The internal paths, perhaps of an initiatory nature, led to the darkest and most hidden spaces, where the most secret rites were probably celebrated. It is possible that ritual deer hunts also took place during these ceremonies, a kind of initiation trial aimed at young archers.

                <b>1.2 The paintings</b><br><br>
                The Deer Cave extends for over 700 meters and features three main corridors, divided into twelve zones. The paintings are gathered in <b>81 groups</b>, made with pigments derived from subfossil guano (brilliant brown), clays and ground bones (yellowish brown), and ochre (red). Most images are abstract: spirals, sinuous lines, complex motifs, and "arabesque" shapes. Some figures derive from increasingly stylized human bodies, eventually becoming almost unrecognizable symbols.
                <br><br>
                Figurative scenes are less frequent but very evocative: <b>deer</b>, <b>men armed with bows</b>, and <b>dogs in hunting episodes</b>, often interpreted as ritual or mythical moments. This choice of representing the symbol more than reality marks a profound difference compared to Paleolithic art.

                <b>1.3 A place of meeting and alliances</b><br><br>
                The ceremonies held in the cave probably involved different groups from distant territories. This sanctuary was likely the place where pacts, alliances, and exchanges of gifts were made, under the protection of underground deities. Materials from distant areas reinforce this idea.

            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <b>1.4 The discovery</b><br><br>
                The cave was discovered on February 1, 1970, by speleologists of the “Gruppo speleologico salentino de Lorentiis” of Maglie (LE), during an excursion in the inlet of Porto Badisco. One of them noticed cool air coming from a crevice and, after removing surface material, uncovered the first deer representations. They first named it “Grotta di Enea” but later “Grotta dei Cervi” due to the many deer hunting scenes.
                <br><br>

                <b>1.5 The Exhibition at the Aragonese Castle in Otranto (LE)</b><br><br>
                The cave is <b>not open to visitors</b> because its delicate humidity and temperature conditions would be altered by human presence. Access is only allowed for study or monitoring with special authorization.
                <br><br>
                In 2004 a project began to create a high-resolution 3D model of the cave. Since 2016, a 3D virtual tour has been available at the Aragonese Castle of Otranto, along with life-size reproductions, ceramics, and pintaderas.
                <br><br>
                Starting September 23, 2025, the exhibition “I luoghi della Preistoria e la Grotta dei Cervi” (“The Places of Prehistory and the Deer Cave”) will present prehistoric materials from the Otranto area, alongside finds from the Deer Cave. A large room is entirely dedicated to the cult site, with ceramics and artifacts linked to shamanic and fertility rites (Late 7th - Early 4th millennium BC), concluding with materials from the Metal Age. The itinerary includes the projection of the 3D cave model.
